# Imperial GLOBUS Lemontree

This repository is used to record code used to download the source data 
and create derived datasets stored in the Imperial Lemontree data storage. 

The datafiles themselves **must not** be added to this repository: GitHub
is not an appropriate file storage solution for large binary files!

There are two root directories:

* `source`: this directory is used to hold copies of directly downloaded
  core source datasets.
  
* `derived`: this directory is used to hold datasets derived from the 
  inputs in `source` that we want to make available.
  
All of the files in this storage are made available via a GLOBUS endpoint.
