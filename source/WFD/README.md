# WFD Datasets

This directory contains variables from the WFD dataset.

* The SWDown data was downloaded using the script provided and then converted from 
  the distributed land-only data to gridded datasets.
* The Tair, Rainf and Snowf data was downloaded elsewhere by Cai Wenjia (Shirley) and
  uploaded here directly. There is currently no scripted download or postprocessing 
  and the files are in the original land-only format.
