1. Product name: Gap-filled fPAR, SNU Version 1, produced in August 2022;
2. Time period: 1982.1 to 2021.12; temporal resolution: daily and monthly; spatial resolution: 0.05deg; size: 3600*7200; filled value for ocean pixels: -10; 
3. The gaps in original 4-day or 8-day fPAR was filled by using a rolling time window (32 day); if there were still gaps, then monthly average was further used to fill the gaps; Gaussian interpolation was used to generate daily data;
4. The fPAR data in AVHRR era was estimated based on the linear regression between AVHRR NDVI and MODIS fPAR for the overlap years;
5. Finally, long-term fPAR data (1982-2021) is consist of AVHRR LAI (1982.1-2000.2) and MODIS (2000.3-2021.12).
