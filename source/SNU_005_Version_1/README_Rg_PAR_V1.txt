1. Product name: Long-term Rg (surface shortwave radiation) and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), SNU Version 1, produced in August 2022;
2. Time period: 1982.1 to 2021.12; temporal resolution: daily and monthly; spatial resolution: 0.05deg; size: 3600*7200; filled value for ocean pixels: -10; 
units: MJ m-2 d-1 (Rg) and mol m-2 d-1 (PAR); 
3. Data in AVHRR era were derived from ERA5, and were then calibrated (matched) with MODIS Rg/PAR;
4. Finally, long-term LAI data (1982-2021) is consist of AVHRR LAI (1982.1-2000.2) and MODIS (2000.3-2021.12);
5. The method for deriving radiation variables can be found in Ryu et al., 2018


- Unit conversion
PAR: 1 W m-2 = 0.3940 mol m-2 d-1
Rg: 1 W m-2 = 0.0864 MJ m-2 d-1
