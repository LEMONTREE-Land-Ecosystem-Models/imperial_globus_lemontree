The incoming data from SNU for these fAPAR and LAI datasets were originally
packaged as daily Matlab matrix files for land cell values and a map from 
matrix index to grid cell coordinates.

These files have been repackaged into annual NetCDF files using a lat/long
grid to make it easier to access and manage the data. The original source
files have been archived as a tgz file.
