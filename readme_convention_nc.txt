This is a brief demonstration of naming convention as well as descriptive readme files of remote sensing data (usually in netcdf <.nc> format) in LEMONTREE repository

Naming convention: [variable name]_[source/dataset if any]_[derived method if necessary]_[period start time]_[period end time]_[version number]_[notes if any]

README file demo:

This folder/pathway stores the [variable] [timestep] data ([unite]) from [period start time] to [period end time] at the spatial resolution of [resolution] from [sensor name if known], file is structured at [2d/3d] [dimensionality]

Input data (if derived and if known):
[variable short name] [unit]: variable long name explained, timestep, derived method if any
